This project showcases a user profile card created using React and Tailwind CSS. The profile card fetches data from the Random User API and displays the user's details in a visually appealing card format.

## Features
Dynamic Data Fetching: Uses the Random User API to fetch user information dynamically.

Responsive Design: Ensures the card layout remains horizontal and visually appealing across all screen sizes, from mobile to desktop.

Modern Styling: Utilizes Tailwind CSS for a sleek, modern look with gradient backgrounds, rounded corners, shadows, and smooth transitions.

Detailed User Information: Displays user's photo, name, gender, phone number, email, date of birth, age, and address in a well-organized manner.

## Technologies Used
React: For building the user interface and managing component state.

Tailwind CSS: For styling the application with utility-first CSS classes.

API Integration: Uses fetch to retrieve data from the Random User API.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
